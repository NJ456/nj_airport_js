As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

/ Don't set a capacity YET!! Create method for when airport is full instead

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
